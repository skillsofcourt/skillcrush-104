		<h1>Hi, I'm Courtney Washington, I have no background in tech but that won't stop me from becoming a programmer. Here is some advice for you!</h1>

			<h4>Remember that everything is about perspective code newbie!</h4>
			<p>If you're new to coding like I am, I want to let you know that you may be unsure about your future right now but this will open doors for you!
			Just remember you are doing something that you have never done before.

			<p>Remember to take breaks and stop being so hard on yourself.
				You working plenty, trying to have a fullfilling life, and you're basically teaching yourself a new language.
				Don't let loneliness and confusion stop you.

			<h4>Remember you define the rules to your own success.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>Plan on being discipline and learning time management. You'll be happy you did.</p>

			<p>Make friends in this field. No one likes learning alone.</p>
